# HEART_DISEASE_PREDICTION
  This predictive approach combines sensor technology, data analytics, and often machine learning (ML) to monitor or anticipate heart rate behavior in real time or over a defined period. 
# 🫀 Heart Rate Prediction and Heart Disease Risk Classification

This project aims to predict heart rate trends and classify heart disease risk using machine learning techniques. Built using Python and Jupyter Notebook, the system leverages clinical and physiological features to analyze cardiovascular health data.

## 🚀 Features

- Predicts heart disease presence based on key physiological inputs.
- Implements supervised learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest).
- Evaluates performance with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
- Can be extended to predict heart rate or integrate wearable device data.

## 📊 Dataset

The project uses the [UCI Heart Disease Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease), which includes features like:

- Age, Sex
- Resting Blood Pressure
- Cholesterol
- Fasting Blood Sugar
- ECG Results
- Max Heart Rate Achieved
- Exercise Induced Angina
- ST Depression, etc.

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/h

How it Works
Data Preprocessing: Clean and normalize clinical data.

Model Training: Train classifiers to distinguish between healthy and at-risk individuals.

Evaluation: Use classification metrics to assess performance.

Prediction: Input custom patient data to predict outcomes.

Model: Random Forest
Accuracy: 87%
Confusion Matrix:
[[13  2]
 [ 1 15]]
 Future Work
Real-time heart rate prediction using PPG data.

Integration with wearable sensors (IoT + health monitoring).

Deployment as a web or mobile app using Streamlit or Flask.

Deep learning models (LSTM/GRU) for continuous heart rate forecasting.
